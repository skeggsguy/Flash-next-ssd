Where DeepSeek is a streaming problem, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next is a **graph-shape** problem. It decodes
fast enough that the bottleneck moved off the disk entirely and onto GPU work the graph did not need
to be doing: needless copies, broken kernel fusions, and an indexer that materialised a table
proportional to context × chunk size on every layer.

Three architectural features make it unusual, and all three cost real work to support:

- **Hyper-connections** — four parallel residual streams instead of one, mixed by a low-rank gate.
  Roughly 30% of decode GPU time, and the source of several fusion-breaking reshapes.
- **A 26.82 GiB PLE table** — far larger than RAM, touched a few rows at a time.
- **Gated DeltaNet on 36 of 48 layers**, with 12 full-attention layers carrying a sparse indexer.

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| Layers | 48 — 36 SSM (gated DeltaNet) + 12 full attention |
| Experts | 512 per layer, 10 active per token |
| Attention | 24 heads, 2 KV heads, `key_length = 256` |
| Indexer | 4 heads, `key_length = 128`, `top_k = 2048`, **`compress_ratio = 4`** on attention layers |
| Hyper-connections | `hc = 4` streams |
| Expert shape | `ffn_gate/up_exps` 2560 → 640, `ffn_down_exps` 640 → 2560 |
| PLE table | 26.82 GiB, 90-byte rows — streamed, never resident |
| Checkpoint | **`Q4_0-Q8out-v3`, 95.5 GiB, 3 shards** (custom, see below). `UD-iQ4_K_XXS` at 82.89 GiB is the smaller alternative |
| Speculation | **native MTP head**, shared (`mtp-shared-Q4_K_M.gguf`, 1.776 GiB), `n-max 3`, `p-min 0.3` |
| KV | F16 |

**Do not launch this by hand. The recipe is `~/models/bin/qwen-q40-server.sh`,** which is the
authoritative configuration and carries the measurement behind every setting in its comments. It is
outside this repo, so what follows is a mirror, not the source of truth.

```bash
~/models/bin/qwen-q40-server.sh          # cache 34, ctx 98304, MTP n-max 3 / p-min 0.3
```

Which expands to roughly:

```bash
LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_LOOKAHEAD=1 LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_WAVE_CAP=200 LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_PARTITION=1 \
llama-server -m <first shard> -md <mtp-shared head> \
  -ngl 99 --moe-stream --moe-stream-cache 34 --moe-stream-io-threads 8 \
  -c 98304 -b 4096 -ub 4096 -cms 4096 -np 1 -fa on \
  --cache-reuse 0 --cache-ram 512 \
  --jinja --reasoning-format deepseek \
  --spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3 --spec-draft-p-min 0.3 --spec-draft-ngl 99 \
  --spec-max-prompt 0
```

**Cache 34, and the wired limit moves with it.** Wired memory cannot be swapped, so
`iogpu.wired_limit_mb` is the safety cap on the whole machine, not a tuning knob — past it Metal
raises a GPU OOM the server reports and survives, instead of the laptop going unresponsive. The
script derives it: cache ≤ 32 → 50176 MiB, cache ≥ 33 → 55296 MiB. **Setting one without the other
is how you get a GPU OOM at load.**

| cache | model wires | verdict |
|---:|---:|---|
| 32 | 46.96 GiB, peak 47.13 under prefill | conservative; zero new swapouts across the test |
| 34 | 51.03 GiB total wired (2026-09-04) | current default; holds up in live use |
| 36 | 51.40 GiB, free memory 0.06 GiB | fastest (~14% prefill) and **the state the machine hung in** |

Watch `sysctl -n vm.swapusage`, not free RAM, which macOS keeps near zero by design. Note that free
memory is ~0.06 GiB at cache 34 as well; what separates it from 36 is that the machine stays
responsive, and that is one steady-state sample, not a peak-under-prefill measurement.

## The checkpoint

Two custom splices exist. **`Q4_0-Q8out-v3` is the default**; `UD-iQ4_K_XXS` is the smaller one and
is what the kernel survey below was built to justify.

### `Q4_0-Q8out-v3` — the default, chosen for quality

bartowski's `Q4_0` with this project's `Q8_0` `output.weight` spliced in, then **unsloth's
`UD-IQ4_XS` spliced into five resident tensor groups**: `attn`, `hc`, `token_embd`, `ssm_out`,
`shexp`. Built 2026-09-02 with `gguf_splice_groups.py --groups attn,hc,token_embd,ssm_out,shexp`.

**It was chosen over `UD-iQ4_K_XXS` for quality, not speed.** Its gate/up experts are `Q4_0` at
4.5 bpw against `IQ3_XXS` at 3.06 bpw, and that is 55% of expert weight. On speed the two are level:
26.5 t/s against 26.0, each at its own best draft depth (measured 2026-08-31).

What the five-group splice buys, against the unspliced `Q4_0-Q8out`, paired 40-chunk perplexity plus
an interleaved speed A/B:

| | unspliced | v3 | change |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| perplexity | 5.2777 | 4.3148 | **−17.79%**, t=7.80, better on 40/40 chunks |
| draft acceptance | 0.751 | 0.817 | +0.066 |
| decode | — | — | −2.7% |
| prefill | — | — | unchanged |
| on disk | — | — | +1.69 GiB |

Hyper-connections alone are −13.14% perplexity for +0.30 GiB; attention adds −8.80% for +0.92 GiB.

**Do not trim the group list on perplexity alone.** `attn,hc,token_embd` measures the same −17.5%,
but draft acceptance falls to 0.710 and decode drops 14%: `ssm_out` and `shexp` are worthless for
perplexity and worth about 11 points of decode.

### `UD-iQ4_K_XXS` — the smaller alternative

`UD-iQ4_K_XXS` is a custom splice, built here rather than downloaded: unsloth's `UD-Q3_K_XL` with 43
of its 48 `ffn_down_exps` replaced byte-for-byte with **MXFP4** from AtomicChat's
`AD-3.84bpw-IQ4_XS-M64`, plus `output.weight` at Q8_0. The five down-projections unsloth deliberately
keeps at Q8_0 (layers 2, 4, 30, 46, 47) are left alone, and the `IQ4_NL` PLE table is kept — the
AtomicChat file ships it at `Q5_1`, 8.9 GiB larger, and that table is streamed per row.

| pattern | n | UD-iQ4_K_XXS (ours) | GiB | UD-Q3_K_XL (base) | GiB |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|---:|
| `per_layer_token_embd` | 1 | IQ4_NL | 26.822 | IQ4_NL | 26.822 |
| `blk.N.ffn_gate_exps` | 48 | IQ3_XXS+IQ4_XS | 14.471 | IQ3_XXS+IQ4_XS | 14.471 |
| `blk.N.ffn_up_exps` | 48 | IQ3_XXS+IQ4_XS | 14.471 | IQ3_XXS+IQ4_XS | 14.471 |
| `blk.N.ffn_down_exps` | 48 | MXFP4+Q8_0 | 21.997 | IQ4_NL+Q8_0 | 23.047 |
| `output.weight` | 1 | Q8_0 | 0.629 | Q6_K | 0.486 |
| `token_embd` | 1 | Q8_0 | 0.629 | Q8_0 | 0.629 |
| `shared experts (*_shexp)` | 192 | Q8_0+F32 | 0.234 | Q8_0+F32 | 0.234 |
| `indexer.*` | 48 | F32+BF16 | 0.037 | F32+BF16 | 0.037 |
| `ple_*` | 6 | F32+Q8_0 | 0.033 | F32+Q8_0 | 0.033 |
| `ssm_* / conv` | 252 | F32+Q8_0 | 0.599 | F32+Q8_0 | 0.599 |
| `hc_* (hyper-conn)` | 387 | Q8_0+F32 | 0.647 | Q8_0+F32 | 0.647 |
| `attn (q/k/v/o/kv)` | 120 | Q8_0 | 2.086 | Q8_0 | 2.086 |
| `routing / norms` | 72 | F32 | 0.234 | F32 | 0.234 |
| **total** | **1224** | | **82.890** | | **83.796** |

**Only two rows differ**, and the result is **0.9 GiB smaller** than the base it came from despite
the larger output tensor. 1180 of 1224 tensors are untouched.

A trap worth recording: `--splice-type IQ4_NL` looks like the obvious selector for the
down-projections, and it also matches `per_layer_token_embd` — the PLE table is IQ4_NL too. With a
full donor, that selector silently swaps the PLE table as well.

### Why MXFP4 — the kernel survey

Every quant format measured at **this model's own expert-GEMM shape**, ranked by time per *effective*
bit-per-weight. Effective BPW includes the block scales, so it is what actually crosses the bus.
Generated by `test-backend-ops perf -o MUL_MAT`; the cases live in the perf suite.

#### Prompt processing — 512 rows per expert (`m=640, k=2560, n=512`)

| Rank | Type | Tensor BPW | Effective BPW | Time | Time / effective BPW |

#### Token generation — one row per expert (`m=640, k=2560, n=1`)

| Rank | Type | Tensor BPW | Effective BPW | Time | Time / effective BPW |

| 7 | Q5_1 | 5 | 6 | 9.48 us | 1.58 us |
| 8 | Q4_K | 4 | 4.5 | 7.82 us | 1.74 us |
| 9 | Q5_K | 5 | 5.5 | 9.59 us | 1.74 us |
| 10 | MXFP4 | 4 | 4.25 | 8.09 us | 1.90 us |
| 11 | IQ4_XS | 4 | 4.25 | 8.14 us | 1.92 us |
| 12 | IQ4_NL | 4 | 4.5 | 8.70 us | 1.93 us |

| 14 | IQ3_S | 3 | 3.4375 | 13.22 us | 3.85 us |
| 15 | IQ3_XXS | 3 | 3.0625 | 22.24 us | 7.26 us |

**The ranking does not follow bit width.** `IQ3_XXS` is the worst format per effective bit in both
regimes despite reading the fewest bytes — its kernel is occupancy-bound on this GPU, and at `n=1`
it is slower in absolute terms than `F16`, which reads five times as many bytes. That is the entire
argument for the splice: `MXFP4` and `IQ4_XS` cost the same 4.25 effective bits, but MXFP4 has a
hand-optimised Metal GEMV here, and both are far better placed than the `IQ3_XXS` they sit beside.

The `ffn_gate`/`ffn_up` pair remains `IQ3_XXS` because it is the bulk of the file and the size
budget has to come from somewhere; `ffn_down` is where the format change buys the most per GiB spent.

## The serving configuration

Settings that are not defaults, each with the measurement that chose it. These lived only in
`~/models/bin/qwen-q40-server.sh` until 2026-09-04; that script is still the source of truth and
carries the longer version of each note.

| Setting | Default | Here | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_LOOKAHEAD` | `n_expert_used` = **10** | **1** | The one-layer-ahead prefetch defaults to the routing width. At 10 it spends drive bandwidth on experts the layer will not use. The in-code table (measured on DSV4-Flash) shows over-wide lookahead going *worse than off* — top-16 dropped 7.3 → 5.0 t/s because ~1000 speculative loads per 2 s starve the demand loads the GPU is blocked on |
| `LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_WAVE_CAP` | 139 (4 waves) | **200** (3 waves) | pp 268.30 → 278.39, tg 22.43 → 23.51 at 44.8k. An interior optimum: at 279 (2 waves) the lost preload overlap costs more than the saved masked passes. Lossless — only GEMM scheduling changes. See [WAVE_CAP forces off a safety net](#wave_cap-forces-off-a-safety-net-2026-09-04) |
| `LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_PARTITION` | off | **on** | pp 278.27 → 297.87, tg 23.53 → 24.06. Paired 40-chunk perplexity **bit-identical** with it off, all 40 chunks matching (4.3387 both). It changes how pairs are assigned to waves, not what is computed |
| `--cache-ram` | 8192 MiB | **512** | The server's store of saved prompt/KV states in plain host RAM — the same pool macOS competes for. Over a 3h13m session, 77 of 82 slot selections hit the live slot by prefix similarity and only 5 by LRU; the prompt cache appears 6 times and **all 6 are evictions**, throwing away 4.87 and 4.67 GiB. It was holding multiple GiB to serve nothing |
| `--cache-reuse` | 256 | **0** | The caching win comes entirely from exact-prefix reuse, which `cache_prompt` already gives you: turn 1 prefilled 1253 tokens in 7.1 s, turn 2 prefilled 27 in 0.77 s — identical at 256 and at 0. `--cache-reuse N` shifts KV chunks past a divergence, which is **approximate**: output can differ where two tokens were nearly tied. Not a risk worth taking for an unmeasured gain |
| `--moe-stream-io-threads` | auto | **8** | 8 / 12 / 16 are indistinguishable |
| `-ub` | 512 | **4096** | The single largest prefill parameter. 8192 GPU-OOMs at cache 36; 2048 costs 11.6% prefill |
| Google Drive | running | **quit for the run** | The repo lives in a Drive sync target, so Drive re-uploads `build/` while the model streams experts off the same SSD. Measured at ~1.9 GB resident and 61% CPU. The script quits it and restores on exit |

---

## What was added, and why

### The indexer — the prefill story

| Change | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Block-level top-k** | the budget is whole blocks anyway, so selecting over blocks skips materialising the `[n_kv, n_tokens]` cell table entirely — this flattens the prefill *curve*, not just its value |
| **Selections mapped through `blk_cells`** | a block id is not a cell base: `set_input_qsa` hands out compacted ids and records members in a table, and the two coincide only when every live cell sits at its own position |
| **Permute-free scoring** | upstream now sums the indexer heads by slices, which removes the same large `permute+cont` this fork removed by putting `q` on the left |
| **F16 indexer keys** | quantising raw index keys changes which blocks survive a discrete top-k, and the 128-wide indexer head cannot tile a 256-block type |
| **Per-query sparse FA** | gathers each query's selected K/V rows directly instead of walking a dense masked row space |

Block-level selection is also a marginally *better* cut: all `r` cells of a block share a score, so a
cell-level top-k split the boundary block arbitrarily. Causality is unaffected — the causal mask is
still applied after selection.

### The graph — the decode story

| Change | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **`RMS_NORM→MUL` adjacency** | Metal's fusion check is a *tensor-identity* test; a reshape between the two silently broke it and spilled the norm to memory |
| **Hyper-connection collapse** | `ggml_cont` before the stream adds bought nothing — ADD needs contiguous *rows*, which a strided view already has — and blocked chain fusion |
| **`ggml_top_k` for MoE routing** | `argsort_top_k` fully sorted all 512 expert scores to view the first 10 |
| **Graph reuse / shared QSA input** | the whole graph was rebuilt and re-recorded every token |

These are GPU work removed, not I/O: stream statistics are unchanged across the change.

### Native MTP head

The model ships a NextN block that upstream's loader reads as part of the trunk and the graph cannot
run. Supporting it needs its own tensors (`fc_embd`, `fc_hidden`, `enorm`, `hnorm`, and a
hyper-connection norm), its own graph, and a hidden-state export from the trunk.

The head is fed the **wide** hyper-connection stream (`hc*n_embd`) from before the final mixer — not
the collapsed output — because its `hnorm` and `fc_hidden` are `[hc*n_embd]`. Three separate things
must hold or acceptance silently collapses to ~1% rather than failing loudly:

1. the trunk must set `res->t_h_nextn` at all;
2. it must be the wide pre-mixer stream, not the mean-pooled one;
3. it needs an explicit `ggml_build_forward_expand` — it is a bare reshape view with no consumer, so
   otherwise the scheduler never assigns it a backend and it is never computed.

**The tell for all three:** acceptance identical to the digit across two different drafter
quantisations. Drafts that do not change when the drafter's weights change are not coming from the
drafter.

An `mtp-` sidecar carries only the NextN block plus embeddings, so the trunk tensors and the PLE
table must be optional when one is loaded.

### PLE table streaming

26.82 GiB of 90-byte rows. Upstream keeps it off the resident set with `TENSOR_READ_LAZY`, which is
**mmap-only by construction** — rows arrive as page faults against a mapping the size of the whole
table. When expert streaming is on, the table is handed to the servicer instead: `set_input` reads
just this ubatch's rows with buffered parallel `pread`s into a compact tensor, and `get_rows`
dequantises that exactly as it would the full table. Repeated rows are read once; reads are sorted by
file offset. Upstream's lazy path remains the fallback.

Deliberately **buffered, not `O_DIRECT`** — at 90 bytes a row the page cache genuinely helps, which
is the opposite of the finding for multi-MiB expert slabs.

### Correctness fixes

| Fix | Consequence if missing |
|---|---|
| **Recurrent-state rollback** | conv history and delta-net groups left zeroed/stale, corrupting generation after any rollback |
| **Indexer cache after sequence copies** | cached indexer keys are raw, so a pending update must not rope-shift them |
| **Spare-block members in `set_input_qsa`** | the unpooled tail — the newest tokens — drops out of the selection entirely |
| **`--spec-max-prompt`** | a draft head is an extra layer over the whole prompt; past a length it cannot pay back |
| **No V cache for the indexer** | the indexer scores keys only; the cache was allocating a V side nothing reads. Presenting its private hparams as MLA-shaped takes `llama_kv_cache`'s existing `has_v = !is_mla` path. Frees 12 × `n_ctx` × 128 B — 288 MiB at ctx 98304, 384 MiB at 131072 (upstream `#28330`) |

---

## Negative results

| Idea | Result |
|---|---|
| **union-8 for the indexer path** | negative below ~96k context and only about +1% above it; the per-query sparse path is the retained design |
| **MTP + n-gram stacked** | net negative — they compete for the same accepted tokens |
| **Deeper MTP drafts** | n-max 2 beats 4. Deeper drafts are accepted less often and the rejected-token verification outweighs the longer runs; depth 1 over-corrects |
| **MTP draft depth as a memory lever** | it is not one — depth 4 → 1 frees only 338 MiB |
| **q8_0 attention KV** | correct, and halves the attention cache, but has not beaten F16 in the Qwen-shaped sparse kernel |
| **`hc_up` matmul at K=320** | a wash, not a win |
| **Upstream `5ea1b124` fa-vec tunings** | rejected — no F16 entry matches head dim 256/256 |
| **Swapping upstream's head-slice sum for our permute-free scoring** | upstream `#28023` already removes the same copy a different way; replacing it is a swap, not a gain |
| **MTP at long context** | **inverts.** At 32k the head costs 3.7 s of prefill and repays after 119 generated tokens; at 128k it costs 57.7 s and repays after 2369 |
| **union-8 for MTP** | does not apply |
| **Deeper drafts** | the expert GEMV n-curve is linear with a cliff at 32; depth does not amortise the weight read |
| **Upstream's `n_kv_max` sparse-FA hint for QSA** (`#27970`/`#28098`) | neutral to within 1% at 32k and 128k. QSA's selection is scattered — top-k picks ~512 four-cell blocks across the whole cache, so nearly every block the kernel could skip still holds a selected cell. **On by default; `LLAMA_QWEN4EXP_SPARSE_FA=0` disables.** See the caveat below |
| **Upstream `#28213` gather-based QSA decode** | 5% slower at 32k, 6% at 128k. It sets `blk_bias = false` to get the per-cell bias, which turns **block top-k off** — that optimisation is worth more than the gather, and the per-query sparse FA above already covers the idea. Not adopted |

**Standing rule: no output-altering optimizations.** Quality is not tradeable for single-digit
percentage gains.

---

## Retractions

**"union-8 gives +4.3% / +6.1%."** Voided — measured on a **broken kernel**.

**"The dk256 union failure is a head-dimension problem."** Also wrong. The root cause was the
**CPU reference's** GQA head mapping; the Metal kernel had been correct all along.

**"Long-context decode collapses."** Wrong. The measurements behind it were 1–8 token generations
that hit EOS immediately. Measured properly with `ignore_eos`, decode at 122k is 7.13 (no spec) /
8.63 (MTP).

**"Block-topk is worth +18.5%."** Under-reported — measured at 32k, where the quadratic is only 18%
of prefill. At 128k it is worth far more.

**"MTP n-max 4."** Then "n-max 2 beats 4". Both superseded: a 22-arm sweep on a real ~24k prompt
settled on **n-max 3, p-min 0.3**, bracketed again at 44.8k, and re-confirmed 2026-09-04 with the
n-gram chain in front. The three figures come from different machines and checkpoints.

**"Chaining n-gram in front of MTP roughly doubles decode."** Measured on the raw `/completion`
endpoint, which bypasses the chat template. Under `--jinja` — what the server actually runs — it is
+9.9% on code and **−6.6% on reasoning**. See [Speculation stack](#speculation-stack-2026-09-04).

**Upstream's `edb6dec1c` "enable recurrent state rollback" looks wrong**: it adds `QWEN4EXP` to the
whitelist, but their tree has neither the ring-bank conv writes nor the delta-net `n_written < K`
clamp, both prerequisites.

**"Sparse FA for QSA is neutral, and off by default behind `LLAMA_QWEN4EXP_SPARSE_FA`."** Both
halves were wrong, and this entry is the reason the gate now exists.

The flag was never real — no such env var existed anywhere in the tree, on this branch or the one
before it. Sparse FA has been **on unconditionally** since `39b1d9ae8`, which replaced the disabled
call with `top_k->ne[0]`.

The "neutral to within 1%" number is worse than stale. It was measured against **this fork's own
sparse kernels**, and the mainline rebase dropped those as duplicates of `#27970`/`#28098`. The
hint now reaches mainline's kernels, which are different code. Nobody has measured it in that form.

The gate is now implemented for real (`qwen4exp_sparse_fa()`), still **on by default** so the
behaviour does not change under anyone silently, with `LLAMA_QWEN4EXP_SPARSE_FA=0` to A/B it
without a rebuild. **Re-measure before quoting the neutral figure again.**

The general lesson is the one this log keeps relearning: a measurement is only as portable as the
code underneath it, and a rebase can move that code without touching the line that records the
result.

## Speculation stack (2026-09-04)

Does chaining `ngram-mod` in front of the MTP head pay? It depends entirely on the endpoint, which
is why the first answer was wrong. Both tables: v3 checkpoint, cache 32, ctx 32768, `np 1`,
n-max 3 / p-min 0.3, one warmup discarded, arm order reversed between passes, swap flat throughout.

**Raw `/completion`, no chat template:**

| traffic | chain off (A/B) | chain on (A/B) | delta | acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| code | 29.77 / 28.37 | 61.95 / 62.25 | +113% | 1.000 both |
| prose | 19.91 / 20.06 | 21.21 / 21.06 | +5.8% | 0.572 both |
| reason | 25.07 / 24.58 | 26.34 / 25.87 | +5.1% | 0.770 both |

**`/v1/chat/completions` with `--jinja --reasoning-format deepseek`, i.e. the real serving flags:**

| traffic | chain off (A/B) | chain on (A/B) | delta | acceptance off → on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| code | 28.71 / 28.33 | 31.39 / 31.31 | +9.9% | 0.685 → 0.626 |
| prose | 20.34 / 19.74 | 20.28 / 20.27 | +1.2% | 0.512 → 0.468 |
| reason | 27.75 / 26.48 | 25.79 / 24.85 | **−6.6%** | 0.780 → 0.613 |

Thinking is on by default under that template, so 800–1200 characters of reasoning precede every
answer, and reasoning text drafts like prose. The +113% depended on acceptance being 1.000 — the
drafter was copying the prompt back. With thinking on it cannot, and reasoning regresses. This is
the mechanism behind the older "MTP + n-gram stacked is net negative" entry, and it says *when*:
the chain only pays where the output repeats the input.

`NGRAM=1` in the server script turns it on; the default is off.

**n-max / p-min re-confirmed with the chain on.** Code saturates at ~62 t/s in every config, so
prose and reason decide it. Prose prefers n2, reasoning prefers n4, and they pull about equally
hard — mean of the two: n2 23.48, **n3 23.62**, n4 23.41, n3/p0 23.58, all within 1%. No change.

---

## Real traffic (2026-09-04)

Two `pi` sessions on the `nitin/mainline` build (33 fork commits replayed onto upstream
`8f83678fd`), served through `--jinja --reasoning-format deepseek`, cache 32, ctx 98304,
n-max 3 / p-min 0.3, n-gram chain off. 9 requests, 117,249 prompt tokens, 24,610 generated.

| prompt | pp t/s | generated | tg t/s | acceptance | mean draft |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 54,443 | 251.1 | 226 | 18.86 | 0.760 | 3.25 |
| 54,722 | 254.6 | 177 | 19.71 | 0.738 | 3.11 |
| 477 | 145.6 | 739 | 18.62 | 0.660 | 2.93 |
| 372 | 85.2 | 722 | 22.57 | 0.667 | 2.86 |
| 7,123 | 235.2 | 11,638 | 18.94 | 0.483 | 2.37 |
| 18 | 28.0 | 10,002 | 21.99 | 0.832 | 3.49 |
| 32 | 28.4 | 365 | 17.12 | 0.808 | 3.39 |
| 34 | 32.0 | 145 | 16.01 | 0.711 | 3.04 |
| 28 | 32.9 | 596 | 15.79 | 0.517 | 2.52 |

**Weighted by tokens produced: 20.16 t/s decode, 0.647 acceptance.** Weight by tokens, not by
request - the two 10k+ generations are the session, and a simple mean (18.85 / 0.686)
over-weights sub-100-token replies whose rate is dominated by fixed overhead. Sub-40-token
prompts show pp 28-33 t/s for the same reason; those are not prefill measurements.

Health: no errors, no aborts, swap flat at ~970 MB throughout. The mainline rebase served two
full real sessions cleanly - better evidence for the switch than the benchmark A/B, which was
contaminated by swap growth.

MTP is worth about +40% here. Un-drafted decode brackets this depth at ~15.5 t/s at 32k and
~9.2 at 131k, so 54k without a draft head would be roughly 13-14 against the 18.9-19.7 measured.

Acceptance ranged 0.483 to 0.832 - the code-vs-reasoning split, in the wild. The two big
generations sat at opposite ends (0.483 over 11,638 tokens, 0.832 over 10,002) yet differed by
only 14% in throughput, which is why adaptive draft depth looked attractive and still lost.

Note the session ran at 0.647, well above the 0.46-0.51 this log records for real traffic.
One session; direction only.

## Open bugs

**`nan` logits on the BLAS backend, from block top-k.** `test-llama-archs -a qwen4exp`, Accelerate
row: `NMSE nan`, roundtrip FAIL. Deterministic across seeds 1–6. Metal and pure CPU are clean, and
the full 606-row suite has no other failure, so the Mac serving path is unaffected.

`LLAMA_QWEN4EXP_BLOCK_TOPK=0` clears it. It survives `LLAMA_QSA_GATHER=0` and
`LLAMA_QWEN4EXP_INDEXER_F16=0`, so it is not the `blk_cells` mapping bug and not the key type.

Ruled out: BLAS claiming an op it does not implement (its `supports_op` is correct — only
`NONE/RESHAPE/VIEW/PERMUTE/TRANSPOSE` and a gated `MUL_MAT`); `ggml_top_k` returning a view (it
returns a fresh contiguous I32 tensor); an all-masked attention row (the CPU kernel skips masked
cells and guards `S == 0`, yielding 0 rather than `nan`).

What is odd: block top-k changes no matmul's shape, so BLAS takes the same matmuls either way, yet
its presence is required to trigger the fault. That points at graph splitting or allocation — BLAS
and CPU share a buffer type, so sched can alias buffers across splits. Needs a debug build with a
graph-eval callback; `llama-eval-callback` cannot help because the synthesised model has no
tokenizer, and `GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=2` is swallowed by the test's logging.

---

## WAVE_CAP forces off a safety net (2026-09-04)

The server script exports `LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_WAVE_CAP=200`. Every start now logs:

    LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_WAVE_CAP=200 forces N waves, below the 600 pairs/wave floor
    - the static chunk bound may abort; unset it to let the planner pick

This is not cosmetic. Reading `llama-graph.cpp` around the wave planner:

- **200 does not mean 200.** It is clamped to `[n_expert_used, n_slots - n_expert_used]`,
  i.e. 86 of 96 slots here. So the setting means "use the widest wave the cache allows".
- **Forcing it disables the widening.** The planner's corrective branch is guarded by
  `!cap_forced`, so with the env var set, the code that keeps mean pairs-per-wave above the
  floor never runs.
- **The floor exists because of a measured abort.** The comment records it: mean 614 pairs
  per wave held at +20% imbalance, mean 308 blew past +43%, and "at cap 30 the tail came
  +50.2% over, aborting between two cap values that both worked". The hazard is the small
  TAIL ubatch of a prefill, whose hot-expert pair counts do not shrink with the ubatch.

So the risk is a hard abort on an unlucky prefill tail, not a slowdown. It did not fire across
117k prompt tokens of real traffic today, but it is disabled protection against a failure this
log has already seen once.

NOT YET MEASURED: whether 200 actually beats unset. It was adopted before pair partitioning
became the default, and partitioning is what sizes the pair lists the floor is about. Since it
clamps to the maximum anyway, "unset" may cost nothing. Measure before deciding.

## Sweeps

| Sweep | Outcome |
|---|---|
| **ubatch / batch** | keep **4096** |
| **Cache size** | 36 is ~14% faster on prefill, ~2% on decode — but 36 + MTP pages. Use **32 with MTP** |
| **MTP quantization** | `Q4_0` (2.20 GiB); Q8_0 (3.85 GiB) gives similar acceptance (0.55 vs 0.51 mean) for 1.75x the footprint |
| **MTP n-max / p-min** | **3 / 0.3**, bracketed at 24k and 44.8k, re-confirmed with the n-gram chain in front |
| **I/O threads with MTP** | keep **8** |
| **Speculation type × cache** | MTP alone beats n-gram alone; the chain only pays without the chat template |

---

## Measurement discipline

- **Measure under the flags the thing actually runs with.** The n-gram chain was measured on
  `/completion` and recommended for a server that passes `--jinja`. The raw endpoint bypasses the
  template, so those numbers described a configuration that never runs. Cost: one wrong default.
- **Run A/B arms as ABA.** This box speeds up as caches warm — four identical runs at d32768 gave
  13.55 → 14.36 → 15.37 → 15.35 t/s. A single on-then-off pair therefore reads as a loss for
  whichever ran first. Run the feature arm on both sides of the control and check the two agree.
- **One run per arm is not a measurement.** Spread at d32768 is ±1.4 t/s on a mean of ~15, about 9%
  — wider than most effects worth chasing.
- **The first request understates decode by ~25%.** Cold 12.20 → warm 16.49 / 16.26 t/s. Multi-arm
  sweeps issuing 3+ requests per arm are unaffected; one-shot verification runs are not.
- **That ~25% is a COLD-START effect, not warm-vs-post-prefill.** Warm decode runs only 2–16% above
  post-prefill at the same depth. Post-prefill is the honest number for agentic use, where every
  turn re-prefills.
- **"It loaded" is not "it fits".** Cache 36 + MTP loads, runs, and pages while doing it. Sample
  `sysctl -n vm.swapusage` around every arm; a rising figure voids the measurement. Watch swap, not
  free RAM, which macOS keeps near zero by design.
- **Warm decode measured once per context carries ~15% variance** — in one sweep the 8k warm figure
  came out *below* its own post-prefill figure, which is physically impossible.
- **A replay trap can fake +33%.** n-gram speculation replaying its own prior output measures
  nothing. Acceptance of exactly 1.000 is the tell that the drafter is copying.
- **Percentages on a curve are meaningless without the length.**
- **Check the harness before the model.** A readiness loop waiting for the wrong log string looks
  exactly like a hung server. The line is `llama_server: listening on http://`. Tags used as
  filenames must not contain `/`, or every server "dies" instantly with an unwritable log.
- **Audit 3-way patch applies for silently reverted hunks** — conflict markers show only part of
  the damage; patch *context* can overwrite untouched work.
- **`git stash pop` leaves merged files staged.** A later bare `git commit` absorbs them. Stage by
  path.

## Backlog, in priority order

### 1. KV cache quantization — frees memory without giving up context

`-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0`. KV is `f16` by default; halving it frees memory for the expert cache **at the
same context length**. At ~85 KB per token, 98,304 context is roughly 8 GB, so this could fund
`--moe-stream-cache 40` with ctx intact.

**Not lossless** — it changes stored attention keys and values. Needs paired perplexity first, then
a speed A/B at cache 40 / ctx 98304. Check in the same run: this model is 36 SSM layers and only 12
attention layers, so KV may be a smaller share of memory than 85 KB/token implies, in which case the
freed memory never materialises. Note the indexer V cache is already gone (above), so part of this
has been banked. ~90 min.

### 2. Adaptive MTP draft depth (upstream `#27210`) — **ported, unmeasured**

Prose wants n2, reasoning wants n4, and a fixed n-max cannot have both — measured twice now. This
climbs and drops the depth per request, so one setting can serve both. The most principled fix for
the split above.

**The port is done and on this branch**, not pending: `--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive`. It reached
`nitin/mainline` late, having been written on `claude/adaptive-mtp` before the rebase and left
behind by it — an earlier version of this entry said it "will not apply cleanly", written when the
port did not exist yet. Both unit tests pass (`test-speculative-adaptive`, `test-arg-parser`).

Two fork-specific conflicts were resolved on the way in. `common/speculative.cpp` — upstream widens
its `spec_mtp` test to include the adaptive type, while this fork carries a `spec_block` clause for
DFLASH/DSPARK that upstream does not have; both kept. And this fork has a **fourth** `DRAFT_MTP`
test upstream does not, in the `-fit` branch of `common_init_from_params`, which decides whether the
draft context is built as `LLAMA_CONTEXT_TYPE_MTP`. With only the non-adaptive type tested,
`--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive` left `ctx_type` unset and the MTP sidecar — which carries no trunk
tensors — was loaded as a full model and segfaulted.

**What is left is the measurement, not the code.** It has never been run against real traffic here.
The bar it has to clear is the fixed `n-max 3 / p-min 0.3`, whose own sweep put prose and reasoning
within 1% of each other, so the win it is chasing is small and the acceptance range in live traffic
(0.483–0.832) is wider than anything the sweep saw.

### 3. The remaining streaming toggles

`WAVE_CAP` and `PARTITION` are done and adopted. `LRU` is skipped — its own comment records +11%
misses. Left, all lossless: **`HOT_DECAY`** (halves route-hotness every 64 remaps; the constant "has
never been measured"), **`PAIR_SLACK`** (50% slack on per-wave pair capacity, more interesting now
that partitioning sizes the pair lists), **`SPEC_MAX`** (prefetch queue depth, default 64).

### 4. A smaller draft head — lossless, modest

Only *below* `Q4_K_M` can win. A `Q3_K_M` head (~2.26 GiB) must hold acceptance above **0.813**;
`shared-Q4_K_M` (1.78 GiB) needs 0.783 but omits `token_embd`/`output` and may not load. A few
percent at best. ~40 min.

### 5. The MTP head runs dense despite shipping sparse weights

A code change rather than a measurement, and the head is ~18% of a decode step. Unscoped.

### 6. F16 `256/256` flash-attention vector tunings

Upstream never tuned this shape. Code plus tuning generation. Unscoped.

## Housekeeping

- **The long-form measurement detail lives in `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next.WIP-yours.md`** (1052 lines,
  uncommitted). This log is the condensed spine; that file still holds the only copy of the
  per-context performance sweeps, the M5 Pro run book, the PLE buffered-vs-uncached study, the
  `GGML_METAL_KPROF` decode breakdown, and the Unsloth variant audit. Fold in or delete
  deliberately — do not lose it by accident.
- **Re-baseline the pre-M5-Pro half of this log, or mark it historical.** Figures older than
  2026-09-03 are M1 Max, several on a checkpoint that no longer exists.
- ~~**Decide whether to keep `LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_PLE_DIRECT`.**~~ Deleted 2026-09-25 with the whole PLE
  row streaming (patch R1, `0eb1ad728`): at `67eb49ef3` nothing called `register_ple`, so the table
  was never registered and the knob did nothing.
- `~/models/qwen38-flash-next-v2` (97 GiB) is superseded by v3 and can be deleted.
- The PLE buffer-overflow fix in `src/llama-moe-stream.cpp` is still uncommitted.

## Closed

- **`--spec-max-prompt`**: set to 0. The limit is cache-blind and disabled MTP mid-conversation.
- **Draft depth and p-min**: `n-max 3`, `p-min 0.3`, bracketed at 24k and 44.8k, re-confirmed 09-04.
- **io-threads and `-ub`**: 8 and 4096 already optimal; `-ub 8192` GPU-OOMs at cache 36.
- **A bigger draft head**: measured −5.2%. Q5/Q6/BF16/F32 all ruled out by the cost model.
- **Per-block bitmap for union-8**: lifted the ceiling 4x, no throughput gain at reachable contexts.
- **MXFP4 vs block-level top-k attribution**: blocked, the `UD-iQ4_K_XXS` checkpoint was deleted.
- **n-gram chained in front of MTP**: measured on both endpoints; opt-in, off by default.
- **Indexer V cache**: removed, 288 MiB at ctx 98304.

## Appendix: the M5 Pro measurement log (2026-08-30 → 2026-09-03)

Kept **verbatim**. This was a separate file (`Qwen3.8-Flash-Next.WIP-yours.md`) that lived only on
this laptop and held most of the measurement this project has taken. It is folded in here rather
than rewritten, because rewriting measurement is how measurement gets lost.

Three things to know before reading it:

- **Where a section above contradicts one here, the section above wins.** It is newer. The
  clearest case is the launch recipe: the command in *Measured on M5 Pro* below is the 2026-09-01
  configuration, and [The serving configuration](#the-serving-configuration) supersedes it —
  the checkpoint, the cache size and the wired limit have all moved since.
- **Check which machine and which checkpoint each figure came from.** Some of this is M1 Max, some
  M5 Pro, and the M5 Pro sections use `Q4_0-Q8out` at 93.82 GiB, not today's v3 at 95.5 GiB.
- **The retractions inside it are load-bearing**, particularly the PLE `+7%/+21%` artifact and the
  MoE dispatch threshold. They are the reason several ideas above are marked closed.

### Performance

#### Where it started

Cache 36, ctx 65536, no speculation, 2 reps x 3 prompts:

| | t/s |
|---|---:|
| prefill (mean) | 121.10 |
| decode (128-tok mean) | 9.548 |

Both figures are from before any of the work below. Prefill reached 167.10 t/s partway through,
after the graph-shape fixes but before block-level top-k.

#### Where it is now

`UD-iQ4_K_XXS`, cache 32, `-b 4096 -ub 4096 -fa 1`, llama-bench (`-r 2`, `-r 1` at 128k), no
speculation. Every cell verified swap-clean:

| context | pp t/s | tg t/s |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 4096 | 160.64 | 10.91 |
| 8192 | 159.11 | 10.82 |
| 16384 | 156.00 | 10.67 |
| 32768 | 150.81 | 10.02 |
| 65536 | 144.37 | 9.19 |
| 131072 | 132.79 | 8.03 |

Prefill falls 17.3% and decode 26.4% across a 32x context range.

#### With MTP

Same model and cache, llama-server, one run per context, MTP as the only variable. Decode is the
*post-prefill* rate in both arms, so the two are directly comparable:

| context | pp no-MTP | pp MTP | tg no-MTP | tg MTP | decode gain |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4,061 | 159.14 | 150.11 | 10.44 | 17.55 | **+68%** |
| 8,307 | 157.03 | 146.91 | 10.70 | 20.47 | **+91%** |
| 16,649 | 155.63 | 147.25 | 10.32 | 19.34 | **+87%** |
| 33,339 | 151.43 | 141.51 | 10.35 | 19.12 | **+85%** |
| 66,505 | 142.62 | 131.97 | 9.38 | 16.57 | **+77%** |
| 129,983 | 131.45 | 119.37 | 8.60 | 12.99 | **+51%** |

**MTP is worth far more than the +39% this log used to record, and it still pays at 128k.** The
earlier figure was measured before the `t_h_nextn` export was fixed, when the head was running on a
hidden state that never reached it - see [Native MTP head](#native-mtp-head).

Prefill costs a steady 5.7-9.2%. End-to-end break-even, from these numbers:

| prompt | extra prefill | decode saved | repays after |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 33k | 15.4 s | 0.0443 s/token | **~350 generated tokens** |
| 130k | 100.2 s | 0.0393 s/token | **~2,550 generated tokens** |

The 130k figure is close to the 2,369 measured previously, so the case for `--spec-max-prompt`
stands. The 32k break-even moved from 119 to ~350 tokens, so the threshold itself is worth
re-deriving rather than inherited.

#### Cache size: 32 vs 36

An earlier version of this log said cache 32 was free, on the grounds that decode measured
identical at 32 and 36. **That was a decode-only measurement, and prefill was never tested.**
Interleaved A/B/A, two passes, same session, swap flat throughout:

| context | cache 36 | cache 32 | delta |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4096 | 186.46 / 186.06 | 160.57 / 160.53 | **-13.8%** |
| 8192 | 185.06 / 184.83 | 159.00 / 158.87 | **-14.1%** |
| 16384 | 180.87 / 181.22 | 156.03 / 156.05 | **-13.8%** |

**Cache 32 costs ~14% prefill and ~2% decode.** The penalty is flat across context, which is the
signature of a per-ubatch cost: every prefill ubatch sweeps the whole expert set, so 11% less
residency means ~14% more compulsory re-reads on each sweep. Prefill here is expert-I/O-bound.

That does not make 36 the right choice, because **cache 36 + MTP pages** (1.1 GiB swap, 5.3M
swapouts). The real choice is *cache 32 with MTP* against *cache 36 without it*, and MTP's +51-91%
decode dwarfs 14% of prefill for anything but a very long prompt with a very short answer.

#### Prefill is a curve, not a number

The single most important result in this log. Block-level indexer top-k did not make prefill
uniformly faster — it flattened its **slope**:

| | ms/token |
|---|---|
| cell-level (before) | `5.828 + 3.864e-5·n` |
| block-level (after) | `6.026 + 6.668e-6·n` |

A **5.8x smaller quadratic coefficient**, at the cost of ~3% on the constant. Worth +14% at 32k,
**+71% at 160k**. Quoting this change as a single percentage is meaningless: measured at 32k it
looks like +18.5%, because at 32k the quadratic term is only 18% of the total.

### Measured on M5 Pro

New machine, and a different checkpoint: `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Q4_0-Q8out` (93.82 GiB, 3 shards) with
the `Q4_K_M` MTP head, not the `UD-iQ4_K_XXS` / `Q4_0` pair the rest of this log uses. Both changed
at once, so **none of these numbers are a same-conditions A/B against anything above.** They are a
new baseline.

Baseline, `llama-bench -p 4096 -n 128 -b 4096 -ub 4096 -fa 1 -r 2`, cache 36, no speculation:
**pp 337.20, tg 21.78**. Roughly 2x the M1 Max figures for the same command shape.

#### Command

```bash
LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_LOOKAHEAD=1 \
llama-server -m <first shard> \
  -ngl 99 --moe-stream --moe-stream-cache 36 --moe-stream-io-threads 8 \
  -c 98304 -b 4096 -ub 4096 -cms 4096 -np 1 -fa 1 \
  -md <mtp-...gguf> \
  --spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 4 --spec-draft-p-min 0 --spec-draft-ngl 99 \
  --spec-max-prompt 0
```

Four things differ from the M1 Max command at the top of this log:

- **`--moe-stream-cache 36`, not 32.** Cache 36 with MTP is clean here up to about 98k context.
- **`-c 98304`, not 131072.** 131072 with cache 36 and MTP hits a GPU OOM. Above ~98k, drop to
  cache 32 and the full 131072 works.
- **Do not set `LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_PLE_DIRECT`.** Measured level with the buffered default, so it
  buys nothing. (Historical: the knob and the PLE row streaming were deleted 2026-09-25, patch R1.)
- **`--spec-max-prompt 0` (off), not 32768.** The flag counts the whole prompt and ignores the
  prompt cache, so in a running chat it disables MTP permanently once history crosses the limit -
  measured on live traffic, that cost 52 seconds on a single request. Only set a limit for one-shot
  long prompts. See
  [MTP across context](#mtp-across-context-and-where---spec-max-prompt-belongs).

Observed with this command at 96k: decode **25.77 t/s**, draft acceptance **0.90** (99 accepted /
110 generated, mean len 4).

#### MTP across context, and where `--spec-max-prompt` belongs

**`--spec-max-prompt 32768` is too generous on this machine. For ordinary answer lengths the
threshold belongs at about 16k.**

Two passes, arm order reversed, one server load per arm with every context measured inside it.
Identical prompt files across arms, `cache_prompt` off, 256 tokens decoded, first request discarded.
Cache 36, `-c 98304`.

| ctx | prompt_n | pp off | pp on | prefill cost | tg off | tg on | decode gain | acc | repays after |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4k | 4,619 | 344.91 | 318.61 | -7.6% | 18.71 | 26.95 | +44.1% | 0.550 | **68 tok** |
| 8k | 9,042 | 344.53 | 319.51 | -7.3% | 18.34 | 24.15 | +31.6% | 0.503 | **157** |
| 16k | 18,154 | 332.51 | 306.68 | -7.8% | 18.03 | 25.21 | +39.9% | 0.569 | **291** |
| 32k | 36,492 | 318.14 | 287.19 | -9.7% | 17.14 | 20.93 | +22.0% | 0.474 | **1,174** |
| 64k | 72,565 | 294.41 | 263.11 | -10.6% | 15.29 | 19.52 | +27.7% | 0.484 | **2,067** |
| 88k | 87,804 | 284.24 | 251.39 | -11.6% | 14.29 | 16.77 | +17.4% | 0.450 | **3,900** |

"Repays after" is end-to-end break-even: extra prefill seconds divided by seconds saved per
generated token. Below that answer length, turning MTP on is a net loss.

Pick the threshold from the answers you actually get back:

| typical answer | MTP pays up to | flag |
|---|---|---|
| ~256 tokens | 8k | `--spec-max-prompt 9042` |
| ~512-1024 tokens | 16k | `--spec-max-prompt 18154` |
| ~2048 tokens | 32k | `--spec-max-prompt 36492` |

**16384 is the sensible default** - it covers answers down to ~300 tokens and is where the curve
turns sharply: break-even quadruples between 16k and 32k (291 -> 1,174 tokens).

Three things differ from the M1 Max numbers higher up this log:

- **The decode gain is much smaller.** +44% at 4k here against +68% there, and +17% at 88k against
  +51% at 130k. MTP still pays, but not by the margin recorded.
- **The 32k break-even is ~1,174 tokens, not ~350.** The old figure is superseded.
- **Decode without MTP is far better** (18.7 vs 10.4 t/s at 4k), which is most of why the *relative*
  gain shrank. The head has less headroom to recover.

Reproducibility, since these are ratios of two measurements: the MTP arm repeated to under 1% at
every context across both passes, acceptance matching to three decimals. The no-MTP arm varied up to
7% on decode, which is the dominant error term. Swap growth was ruled out as a cause - the 32k
decode dip reproduced identically at 3,445 MB and 2,765 MB of swap.

Run it with `~/models/bin/mtp-baseline.sh`.

#### On live traffic the limit is a trap

The synthetic table above measures **cold** prefill: every request pays for the whole prompt. A real
chat does not. `can_speculate()` compares `task->n_tokens()` - the entire prompt - against the limit,
with no knowledge of how much is already cached, so once a conversation crosses the threshold MTP
switches off for the rest of the session.

Caught on a real session running `--spec-max-prompt 16384`:

| task | context | drafted | decode |
|---:|---:|---|---:|
| 0 | 402 | 0.590 | 25.78 t/s |
| 2 | 13,052 | 0.628 | 23.59 |
| 106 | 13,824 | 0.683 | 26.54 |
| 195 | 17,205 | **no** | **15.40** |
| 660 | 21,065 | **no** | **14.56** |
| 1023 | 27,488 | **no** | **16.17** |

The cutoff lands exactly at the limit, and decode drops ~40%. Task 1023 generated 3,928 tokens in
243 s; at the 20.9 t/s measured for that context it would have taken ~188 s, against roughly 2.4 s
of extra prefill on its 7,080 uncached tokens. **The limit spent 52 seconds to save 2.**

Note also that acceptance on real prose ran **0.59-0.68**, well above the 0.45-0.57 the synthetic
keyword prompts produced. MTP is worth more on real traffic than the table above suggests.

**So: `--spec-max-prompt 0` for interactive use.** A limit only makes sense for one-shot long
prompts with short answers, where the cache never helps - and there the break-even table applies.
Fixing this properly means counting uncached tokens rather than the whole prompt.

#### Rebuilding the MTP draft head

The head is **not** produced by this repo's converter. `conversion/qwen4exp.py` sets
`supports_mtp_export = False`, and commit 542888199 ("qwen4exp: native MTP head support") changed
only C++, so the tree can read a head format it cannot write. Nothing on HuggingFace ships that
format either: every published MTP sidecar uses upstream naming.

It is built instead by rewriting an upstream sidecar, with `~/models/bin/mtp_sidecar.py`:

```bash
D=~/models/qwen38-flash-next-mtp
curl -fL --retry 5 -C - -o $D/mtp-src-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF/resolve/main/MTP/mtp-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Q4_K_M.gguf
python3 ~/models/bin/mtp_sidecar.py \
  --src $D/mtp-src-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  --out $D/mtp-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

Two renames and one split, byte exact - no requantization:

| upstream | this fork |
|---|---|
| `blk.48.nextn.eh_proj` `[5120, 2560]` | `nextn.fc_embd` + `nextn.fc_hidden`, `[2560, 2560]` each |
| `blk.48.nextn.hc_head_norm/down/up` | `blk.48.nextn.hc_norm/hc_down/hc_up` |

**Never pass `--swap-halves`.** Which half of `eh_proj` is `fc_embd` cannot be read off the file, and
the wrong choice does not error - it silently collapses drafting. Measured both ways: default gives
**0.50 acceptance, mean len 3.0**; swapped gives **0.00000, 0 accepted of 1186**. Always confirm
acceptance is near 0.50 after rebuilding, not just that the server started.

#### Context vs cache size: where the config stops working

One short generation per arm, `vm.swapusage` sampled around each, everything but `-c` and the cache
budget held fixed, MTP on:

| ctx | cache | result |
|---:|---:|---|
| 32768 | 36 | clean, generates |
| 65536 | 36 | clean, generates |
| 98304 | 36 | clean, generates |
| 131072 | 36 | **GPU OOM** (`kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory`), 3.4 GB swapped |
| 131072 | 32 | clean, generates |

Raising `-c` alone takes the configuration from working to not working, so the full-context KV cache
really does compete with the expert cache. Metal does not quietly skip committing it.

RSS grows about 0.5 GiB per 32k of context, consistent with 24 KiB/token
(12 attention layers x 2 kv heads x 256 dim x 2 for K+V x 2 bytes).

#### Cache 36 vs 32, interleaved

`-p 4096 -n 128 -r 2`, A/B/A/B, both pass-1 arms swap-clean:

| pass | cache | pp4096 | tg128 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 36 | 337.20 | 21.78 |
| 1 | 32 | 291.06 | 20.61 |
| 2 | 36 | 329.49 | 21.06 |
| 2 | 32 | 283.41 | 18.83 |

**Cache 32 costs ~14% prefill**, reproducing the M1 Max finding on different hardware and a
different checkpoint. The decode cost is noisier here than the ~2% recorded earlier.

**Practical rule: cache 36 up to ~98k context, cache 32 above it.** Dynamic KV laddering would only
help a session that starts short and later needs more than ~98k; it is not worth the invasiveness.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Superseded 2026-09-03: the default is now cache 32 at every context.** The rule above is
> correct on speed and was overruled on memory. Cache 36 does not leave the machine enough RAM to
> survive a coding session running alongside the model. See the next section for the numbers.

#### What the model actually costs in memory

**Measured 2026-09-03 on this machine (M5 Pro, 64 GB), server running, `vm_stat` wired pages
against a 2.42 GiB idle baseline.** Every earlier entry in this log measured *speed* at a given
cache size; none of them recorded what the configuration costs in memory, which is why the machine
kept hanging.

| cache | model wired | peak under 3.7k prefill | free | new swapouts |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 36 | **51.40 GiB** | - | 0.06 GiB | swap already engaged, 9,428 |
| 32 | **46.96 GiB** | **47.13 GiB** (48,258 MiB) | 0.06 GiB | **zero** |

**Cache 36 wires 51.4 of the 64 GiB, and that was measured with omp NOT running** - only an editor,
Drive and a terminal alongside. That is the state the machine hung in on 2026-09-03, when a 3h13m
omp session against this server froze the UI for 32 s at a stretch while using 121 ms of CPU.

Dropping to cache 32 frees 4.44 GiB and the prefill test produced **zero new swapouts**. Note that
`free` reads 0.06 GiB in both arms and is *not* the signal to watch - macOS fills free memory with
cache. Swapouts and the compressor are the real indicators.

**`iogpu.wired_limit_mb` is the safety cap, and it was set backwards.** The launch script raised it
to 57344 (56 GiB), which leaves macOS ~8 GiB and cannot be reclaimed because wired memory never
pages out. It is now 50176 (49 GiB), about 1.9 GiB over the measured cache-32 peak. The point of a
*lower* cap is the failure mode: past it Metal raises a GPU OOM the server reports and survives,
instead of the whole laptop going unresponsive. 49152 (48 GiB) was tried and rejected - only
894 MiB over the peak, and it is *below* what cache 36 needs, so it would not load at all.

**The wave-cap tuning survives the cache reduction.** Slots per layer go 289 -> 257 of 512, and the
`LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_WAVE_CAP=200` optimum still applies and still yields 3 waves on a large batch
(`wave cap = 200 of 257 slots, 3 waves, partition ON`). The small-batch default moves 139 -> 123
with the wave count unchanged at 4. **This does not extend downward:** the cap is clamped to
`[n_expert_used, n_slots - n_expert_used]`, so below roughly a 26 GiB cache the ceiling falls under
200 and the tuning would be silently clamped away.

**Quality is untouched, exactly.** The expert cache decides which weights are already resident
versus re-read from disk. Same weights, same arithmetic, same outputs - unlike `--cache-reuse N`,
which is genuinely approximate and stays off.

**`--cache-ram` was never set and defaulted to 8192 MiB.** That is a host-RAM store of saved
prompt/KV states, separate from the live slot's KV and from `cache_prompt` prefix reuse. In the
3h13m session it appeared six times and **all six were evictions**, discarding entries of 4.87 and
4.67 GiB, while 77 of 82 slot selections hit the live slot by prefix similarity. It was holding
multiple GiB to serve nothing. Now 512.

#### PLE reads: buffered vs uncached

**Verdict: keep buffered. Uncached reads make no measurable difference.**

(Historical. The knob and the PLE row streaming were deleted 2026-09-25, patch R1 `0eb1ad728`: at
`67eb49ef3` `register_ple` had no caller, so the PLE path was already dead there.)

`LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_PLE_DIRECT` opened the PLE file with `F_NOCACHE` and reads uncached. Two
interleaved pairs on a fixed build, order reversed for the second pair, 11196-token prefill with
`cache_prompt` off, 256 tokens decoded, first request of each arm discarded as cold:

| arm | order | pp | tg |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| buffered | first | 313.37 | 24.03 |
| direct | second | 317.98 | 22.91 |
| direct | first | 321.84 | 22.96 |
| buffered | second | 319.21 | 22.65 |

Means: **pp 316.3 -> 319.9 (+1.1%), tg 23.34 -> 22.94 (-1.7%)**. Both gaps sit inside the buffered
arm's own run-to-run spread (2.7% on prefill, 5.9% on decode across four loads), so neither is a
real effect. Swap fell slightly during every arm, buffered included.

#### The earlier +7%/+21% result was an artifact

The first version of this measurement was invalid, for two independent reasons.

**The read path was broken.** A direct read is block-aligned: it rounds the offset down to a 4096
byte boundary and reads a whole block. The PLE branch handed it `w.dst`, the **90-byte** row
destination, so every uncached row read wrote up to 8 KB into a 90-byte buffer and then returned
the row at `staging + head`, an address the caller never reads. `w.dst` got the aligned block start
instead of the row. The model was computing on wrong PLE values while overrunning its own buffer.
The expert path had this right all along, and its comment says so: the direct path keeps a staging
buffer because block-aligned reads "would scribble outside the slot". The fix bounces the row
through that same staging buffer and copies `row_size` bytes out.

Under a real prefill the bug is not subtle. It fails outright:

```
decode() failed: PLE row streaming: a previous model read failed
```

**The benchmark measured nothing.** The harness sent the same short prompt three times with the
prompt cache on, so requests 2 and 3 prefilled 4 tokens. `prompt_per_second` over 4 tokens is noise,
and 4 tokens is few enough PLE rows that the overflow stayed under the crash threshold. That is why
the broken path looked fast rather than looking broken.

Two smaller harness bugs sat underneath: a `local path` in the zsh driver shadowed `PATH` (zsh ties
the two), and piping response JSON through zsh's `echo` expanded the `\n` escapes inside string
values, so every parse failed into a `|| echo 0` fallback.

**Caveat:** these arms ran with 1.5-1.9 GB of swap already in use, not from a cold boot. That is
not the confound it would have been for the old claim: the buffered arm scored the same at 198 MB
of swap as at 1.9 GB, so the page-cache-competition mechanism the old entry proposed does not show
up at this scale either.

#### The MoE dispatch threshold is correct

Metal takes the grouped matrix path for `MUL_MAT_ID` only at batch >= 32 (`ne21_mm_id_min`); an MTP
verify batch of 5 falls to the per-token vector path. The vector path does not amortise the weight
read at all - `test-backend-ops perf`, one shape:

| n | us/run | us/token | TFLOPS |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 74.93 | 74.93 | 1.34 |
| 2 | 144.66 | 72.33 | 1.39 |
| 4 | 287.98 | 72.00 | 1.40 |
| 8 | 572.37 | 71.55 | 1.41 |

Only 4.5% per-token improvement from n=1 to n=8. But **forcing the matrix path at small batch is far
worse**: with the threshold dropped to 2, the same n=8 case runs 1252 us and 1453 us against 600 us
and 572 us, i.e. **2.1x to 2.5x slower**, 0.64/0.55 TFLOPS against 1.34/1.41.

So the threshold is right, and cross-token expert dedup is the only remaining lever below it - worth
about 6% at batch 5, since only ~3 of 50 expert draws from 512 collide. Not pursued.

#### Unsloth variants: full audit, and what is worth borrowing

Every published `unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF` variant, read from the GGUF headers themselves
(remote ones over HTTP range requests, `~/models/bin/gguf_probe.py`). "cache fit" is what fraction
of the expert weight the 36 GiB expert cache can hold.

| model | total | experts | dense | PLE | cache fit | expert format |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| UD-IQ3_XXS | 76.3G | 45.3G | 4.21G | 26.8G | 79% | IQ2_S, i-quant |
| UD-Q3_K_XL | 83.8G | 52.0G | 4.98G | 26.8G | 69% | IQ3_XXS, i-quant |
| UD-IQ4_XS | 87.2G | 55.4G | 4.98G | 26.8G | 65% | IQ3_S, i-quant |
| **local Q4_0-Q8out** | **93.8G** | **63.6G** | **3.43G** | **26.8G** | **57%** | **Q4_0** |
| UD-Q4_K_XL | 103.7G | 71.7G | 5.13G | 26.8G | 50% | Q4_K / Q5_1 |
| UD-Q5_K_XL | 147.4G | 91.6G | 5.13G | **50.7G** | 39% | Q5_K |
| UD-Q6_K_XL | 157.5G | 101.7G | 5.13G | **50.7G** | 35% | Q6_K |
| Q8_0 | 175.3G | 119.5G | 5.09G | **50.7G** | 30% | Q8_0 |

**Two facts settle which variants are even candidates.**

- **Q5_K_XL and above double the PLE table, 26.8 -> 50.7 GiB.** That table is streamed per row on
  every token, so it is the worst place in the model to spend bytes. Disqualifying, whatever the
  quality.
- **Everything below the local checkpoint is i-quant** (92-100% of expert weight). Measured here:
  `q4_0` beats `iq3_xxs` by 27% at decode *while reading 47% more bytes*. Smaller and slower.

That leaves **UD-Q4_K_XL** as the only credible whole-model alternative, and it costs 13% more
expert bytes for K-quant experts and a better dense trunk.

The local checkpoint is already at the speed optimum: fastest Metal kernels, highest expert-cache
residency of any non-i-quant option. **Its one real deficit is the dense trunk, 3.43 GiB against
unsloth's 4.98-5.13 GiB.** That is resident memory, not streamed, so closing it costs nothing per
token. This is what makes selective borrowing better than switching models.

#### Corrections to the earlier audit

An earlier version of this section (2026-09-01) got the shape right and three numbers wrong. Deltas
below are measured, and are *increments over the local tensor*, not unsloth's group totals:

| item | earlier claim | measured |
|---|---|---|
| hyper-connections | +630 MB | **+0.30 GiB** (630 MB is unsloth's total for the group) |
| shared experts | +245 MB | **+0.04 GiB** (local already has half at Q8_0) |
| vision projector | 1.1 GiB | 0.84 GiB |
| attention projections | *not listed* | **+0.92 GiB, the largest dense gap** (all 120 `attn_*` at Q8_0 vs mostly Q4_0) |
| `ssm_out` | *not listed* | +0.13 GiB |
| `output.weight` | *not listed* | **local is already better**: Q8_0 vs unsloth's Q6_K. Do not take theirs |

Confirmed exactly: the IQ3_S gate/up finding, dense trunk 4.98 vs 3.43 GiB, Q8_0 down experts on
layers 2/4/30/46/47, `token_embd` +0.30 GiB, and the PLE table at zero cost - both are
28,800,138,240 bytes, dims `[160, 320001536]`, 90-byte rows. `ple.type` and `ple.row_size` are read
from the tensor (`llama-moe-stream.cpp`), so the streaming path is type-generic, and Metal has
`get_rows_iq4_nl`.

#### The plan

Build **one** spliced checkpoint rather than three: each build is ~97 GiB of writes, and only the
PLE swap carries a kernel-speed risk worth isolating.

| step | what | cost |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Quality harness first: fixed `llama-perplexity` subset, run on the current checkpoint as the baseline | ~1 h |
| 2 | Generalise `gguf_splice.py` to "take these tensor groups from that donor" | - |
| 3 | Build one checkpoint: PLE `IQ4_NL` (+0.00), attention (+0.92), `hc_*` (+0.30), `token_embd` (+0.30), `ssm_out` (+0.13), shexp (+0.04), the 5 Q8_0 down-expert layers (+1.66) | ~97.2 GiB |
| 4 | Speed A/B against the current checkpoint, then perplexity against the step-1 baseline | ~2 h |
| 5 | Bisect only if speed regressed; the PLE swap is the first suspect | - |

Deferred: **UD-Q4_K_XL** (103.7 GiB download) only if step 4 shows quality is still short.

**State the evidence bar before measuring.** Perplexity differences from splices this size may be
smaller than a scoped run can resolve. Going Q4_0 -> Q8_0 on the dense trunk is unambiguously higher
fidelity; the open question is whether it is *observable*. If perplexity cannot separate them, the
honest conclusion is "no measurable harm, theoretically better, free at runtime" - not "improved".

#### Measuring quality: headline perplexity is not sensitive enough

Baseline on the current checkpoint, `wiki.test.raw`, `-c 4096 -b 4096 -ub 4096`, cache 36, 20 chunks:

```
Final estimate: PPL = 4.5794 +/- 0.05253      (13.90 s per pass)
```

**That error bar is +/-1.15%, and these splices should move perplexity by a few tenths of a percent.**
Comparing two headline numbers therefore proves nothing. The test set holds only ~80 chunks at this
size, so even using all of it only reaches +/-0.58%.

**Use a paired per-chunk comparison instead.** Chunk difficulty varies far more than the models do
(the running mean moved 4.29 -> 4.58 within this one run), and that variance is identical for both
models, so it cancels in the difference. `llama-perplexity` prints a running mean after each chunk,
from which each chunk's own NLL follows exactly:

```
NLL_i = i*ln(running_i) - (i-1)*ln(running_{i-1})
```

Run both checkpoints over the same chunks, difference them per chunk, and test whether the mean
difference is distinguishable from zero. Same compute, far more resolution. `~/models/bin/ppl_pair.py`
does the extraction and the test.

#### Result: the borrowed checkpoint is 18% better on perplexity

Built with `~/models/bin/gguf_splice_groups.py --groups attn,hc,token_embd,ssm_out,shexp,ple,down5`:
691 tensors replaced, 93.82 -> 97.37 GiB. Both checkpoints over the same 40 chunks:

```
headline PPL  baseline : 5.2777 +/- 0.04479
headline PPL  borrowed : 4.3290 +/- 0.03399      (-17.98%)

paired mean NLL diff   : +0.19815 +/- 0.02512 (1 s.e.)
  t = +7.89 over 39 d.o.f.,  better on 40/40 chunks
```

**40 of 40 chunks, t = 7.9.** Not noise. The borrowed model also generates coherent, accurate prose,
so this is not a broken model producing a flattering loss.

#### Bisection: the PLE table contributes nothing; the dense trunk carries all of it

The obvious explanation was the PLE table - 26.82 GiB, ~29% of the model, read on every token at
every layer, `Q4_0` symmetric with no zero-point against a fitted `IQ4_NL` codebook at the same
bytes. **That explanation is wrong.** Same paired test, same 40 chunks:

| variant | PPL | vs baseline | t | chunks better |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline | 5.2777 | - | - | - |
| PLE swap only | 5.1708 | -2.03% | 1.98 | 26/40 |
| everything EXCEPT the PLE swap | 4.3148 | **-18.24%** | 7.80 | **40/40** |
| both | 4.3290 | -17.98% | 7.89 | 40/40 |

**The 3.55 GiB dense trunk carries the entire effect.** The PLE swap does not clear significance on
its own, and adding it to the trunk changes nothing (-18.24% -> -17.98%, inside noise).

**So drop the PLE swap.** It buys nothing measurable and it was the only component carrying a
speed risk (`IQ4_NL` `get_rows` on the streamed path). The recipe to adopt is:

```
--groups attn,hc,token_embd,ssm_out,shexp,down5      # +3.55 GiB, -18.24% perplexity
```

Still unattributed inside the trunk. The two candidates by prior are `down5` (1.86 GiB, the five
layers unsloth protects for high activation kurtosis) and `token_embd` (Q4_0 symmetric on a 248k
vocab - the same failure mode wrongly attributed to the PLE table above). If one dominates, the
recipe could shrink well below 3.55 GiB.

#### Speed: 18% better quality costs 3.3% decode

Same harness as the tuning sweep - real ~24k prompt, two passes with order reversed, tuned MTP flags
(n-max 3, p-min 0.3) held constant, only `-m` differs:

| | prefill | decode | draft acceptance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline | 278.46 | 26.64 | 0.751 |
| v2 (`attn,hc,token_embd,ssm_out,shexp,down5`) | 278.02 | 25.77 | **0.871** |
| delta | -0.2% | **-3.3%** | **+16.0%** |

v2 repeated to 0.1% on decode across both passes; the baseline's own spread was 2.5%, so the 3.3%
cost is real but small. **Prefill is unchanged.**

**Draft acceptance rose 0.751 -> 0.871 with an unchanged draft head.** The head is the same
`Q4_K_M` sidecar; a higher-fidelity target simply agrees with its drafts more often. That is a
second, independent confirmation that the trunk splice improved the model - acceptance is measured
by token agreement, not by loss.

**Verdict: adopt.** -18.24% perplexity for -3.3% decode and +3.55 GiB is a good trade.

#### Attribution: hyper-connections carry the quality, but perplexity is the wrong target

Each group spliced on its own, same paired 40-chunk test against the same baseline:

| group | size | perplexity | t | chunks better | per GiB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **hc** | +0.30 | **-13.14%** | 6.53 | **40/40** | **-43.8%** |
| **attn** | +0.92 | **-8.80%** | 6.01 | 38/40 | -9.6% |
| token_embd | +0.30 | -2.41% | 2.76 | 25/40 | -8.0% |
| down5 | +1.86 | -1.53% | 2.23 | 23/40 | -0.8% |
| ssm_out | +0.13 | -0.37% | 0.30 | 27/40 | - |
| shexp | +0.04 | +0.01% | -0.01 | 22/40 | - |

**Hyper-connections are the single biggest lever in the model: -13% perplexity for 0.30 GiB.** They
are the 4-stream residual mixer, run on every token at every layer, and the local checkpoint had
them at Q4_0. The chunk-win column is the robustness check: 40/40 and 38/40 are unambiguous, while
`token_embd` and `down5` clear t>2 while winning barely half the chunks.

**But minimising on perplexity is a trap.** Combined builds, all statistically identical on
perplexity, differ five-fold in decode:

| build | groups | size | perplexity | draft acceptance | decode |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| v2 | all six | +3.55G | -18.24% | 0.871 | -3.3% |
| **v3** | no down5 | **+1.69G** | -17.79% | 0.817 | **-2.7%** |
| v4 | attn,hc | +1.22G | -17.70% | not measured | - |
| v5 | attn,hc,token_embd | +1.52G | -17.52% | **0.710** | **-14.0%** |

**Decode tracks draft acceptance, not size and not perplexity.** `ssm_out` and `shexp` contribute
nothing measurable to perplexity and are worth ~11 points of decode, because they lift acceptance
from 0.71 to 0.82. v5's acceptance is *below* the unspliced baseline's 0.751.

The likely mechanism: the MTP sidecar is derived from unsloth's own quantisation, so the draft head
agrees best with a target whose numerics resemble the model it came from. The closer the trunk gets
to unsloth's precision profile, the more drafts survive verification.

**Adopt v3: `--groups attn,hc,token_embd,ssm_out,shexp`, +1.69 GiB, -17.79% perplexity, -2.7%
decode.** Do not minimise the group list on perplexity alone - v4 and v5 look equivalent on quality
and are not, and v4's acceptance was never measured.


#### Decode levers at 44.8k: speculation is already optimal

Two levers, measured at 44,808 tokens on a prompt built from recorded omp sessions - the length
this box actually works at, not the 24k the earlier sweep used. Two passes, order preserved,
v3 + the Q4_K_M head throughout.

| config | prefill | decode | vs base | acceptance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| base (n-max 3, p-min 0.3, cache 36, ctx 98304) | 270.82 | 23.48 | - | 0.868 |
| **cache 42, ctx 65536** | 269.29 | **24.00** | **+2.2%** | 0.844 |
| n-max 4 | 266.65 | 22.84 | -2.7% | 0.771 |
| p-min 0.5 | 269.69 | 22.21 | -5.4% | 0.901 |
| n-max 2 | 270.23 | 21.55 | -8.3% | 0.903 |

**`n-max 3` is bracketed on both sides and `p-min 0.3` beats 0.5.** The hypothesis behind the sweep -
that acceptance falls at long context and should favour shallower drafts - is wrong: acceptance at
44.8k is 0.844 against 0.850 at 24k. It barely moves. The 24k tuning transfers.

Note the shape of the losing arms: **`n-max 2` and `p-min 0.5` both reach ~0.90 acceptance and are
the two slowest.** Acceptance is not the objective. Tokens per unit time is, and a shallower or more
timid draft produces fewer tokens per verify step.

The cache arm is the only win, and its mechanism is visible in the numbers: **acceptance is
identical (0.844 vs 0.844) and prefill is flat**, so nothing about speculation changed - only how
much expert weight fits in cache. It is small, though: +2.2% against a baseline whose own two passes
differed by 1.8%. Also note the baseline's acceptance swung 0.844 -> 0.892 between passes, so small
acceptance differences between configs mean nothing.

**Not adopted.** Dropping ctx to 65536 forces omp's contextWindow to ~64,512 and compaction to
31,744 - below the ~38k sessions actually reach. One extra compaction costs minutes; 2.2% of decode
saves seconds.

#### A bigger draft head is a loss

`Q8_0` head (3.85 GiB) against the shipped `Q4_K_M` (2.59 GiB), same target, 24k prompt:

| head | size | prefill | decode | acceptance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Q4_K_M | 2.59 GiB | 280.75 | **26.16** | 0.850 |
| Q8_0 | 3.85 GiB | 280.58 | 24.80 | 0.888 |
| | +49% | -0.1% | **-5.2%** | +4.5% |

Speculative decoding is lossless - the target verifies every drafted token - so a better head can
only ever be a speed change. It was a negative one. **The head runs `n-max` times per verify step
while the target runs once**, so its cost carries a 3x multiplier, and at 0.850 acceptance only 16%
of headroom remained in tokens-per-step.

Solving the cost model from the two points: **3.18 ms per GiB per draft pass; the head is ~18% of a
decode step.** Break-even acceptance for a *smaller* head: 2.26 GiB needs 0.813, 1.78 GiB needs
0.783. `Q5_K_M` and `Q6_K` heads would be **larger** than `Q4_K_M`, so they move the wrong way, and
`BF16` (7.24 GiB) is far worse. An F32 head is meaningless - unsloth's source is BF16, so it would
be an upcast carrying no extra information.

#### Where decode time actually goes (GGML_METAL_KPROF, 2026-09-03)

First op-level profile of this model. `GGML_METAL_KPROF=1`, v3 + Q4_K_M head, n-max 3, 64 decoded
tokens, 850 decode-graph executions attributed:

| op | ms | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| MUL_MAT | 876.3 | 43.2% |
| MUL_MAT_ID (MoE experts) | 405.1 | 20.0% |
| **CPY** | **330.7** | **16.3%** |
| GATED_DELTA_NET | 56.2 | 2.8% |
| CONT / MUL / ADD / GET_ROWS | ~190 | ~9% |

Top individual nodes:

```
14.9%  303.4 ms  CPY  cache_s_l2 (view) (copy of (view))
 7.9%  160.2 ms  MUL_MAT_ID  ffn_moe_down-1
 6.8%  137.1 ms  MUL_MAT_ID  ffn_moe_gate-1
 6.0%  120.9 ms  MUL_MAT  node_469
```

**The single most expensive node in a decode step is a state copy, not a matmul.** It is the
recurrent conv-state write-back in `build_conv_state` (`src/models/qwen4exp.cpp:1548`). With
speculation on, `n_rs_seq = draft.n_max` (`common/common.h:404`), and the graph writes
`K = n_rs_seq + 1` banks per SSM layer per step:

```c
const int64_t K = (int64_t) cparams.n_rs_seq + 1;
for (int64_t t = 1; t <= K; ++t)
    ggml_build_forward_expand(gf, ggml_cpy(ctx0, ggml_cont(ctx0, tail), dst));
```

At n-max 3 that is **4 conv-state copies per layer per step across 36 SSM layers**.

Two consequences:

- **The depth sweep was measuring two costs, not one.** Deeper drafts run the head more times *and*
  add a bank per layer per step. That is why n-max 4 lost as clearly as it did.
- **The DeltaNet computation is 2.8%; the copying around it is 16.3%.** Any plan to port a faster
  GDN kernel (e.g. from Perplexity's Lily) is chasing the wrong 3%.

#### Closed: the CPY share is a profiling artifact

Chased to the end, and **there is nothing to fix here.** Three corrections, each overturning the
last:

1. **16.3% was share within one subgraph.** A 48-layer model does not fit in 167 nodes; decode spans
   several graphs. Across all of them `CPY` is 11.5%, of which `cache_s*` is 10.4%.
2. **It is not the `K = n_rs_seq + 1` conv ring.** Profiling at n-max 3 (K=4) and n-max 1 (K=2) gave
   5.42 and 5.11 ms per token - **6% apart for double the banks.** The real node is the "extra
   states" copy in `build_rs` (`src/llama-graph.cpp:3830`).
3. **That copy is ~0.24% of decode, not 10%.** Sized against measured hardware:

| | |
|---|---|
| one SSM state row | 786,432 elements = 3.0 MiB fp32 |
| traffic per decode step | 216 MiB (36 layers, read + write) |
| measured bandwidth ceiling | **668 GB/s** (`test-backend-ops perf -o ADD`, 24 MB buffer) |
| so the copy costs | **0.34 ms/step = 0.094 ms/token** |
| against a 40 ms/token step | **0.24%** |
| KPROF claimed | 5.42 ms/token, 10.4% |

**KPROF charges roughly 500 us to every node it samples.** A 3.0 MiB copy is ~9 us of real work, so
it appears ~60x more expensive than it is. Large `MUL_MAT` nodes carry enough real work to swamp the
overhead, small nodes do not - so **KPROF systematically over-weights cheap ops**. Treat its output
as a node inventory, not a cost model. `test-backend-ops perf` gives trustworthy per-op numbers.

The lesson generalises: `MUL_MAT` at 48% and `MUL_MAT_ID` at 18.9% are the only entries in that
table large enough to trust, and they say what was already known - this model is dominated by dense
matmul and MoE dispatch, both already investigated.

#### Streaming toggles: two real wins, both lossless

Ten env toggles had never been measured here. Reading them first was cheaper than sweeping them:
`LRU` self-documents as "+11% misses" and was skipped on that basis, and the `WAVE_CAP` comment
named the open question directly - whether the masked GEMM passes are "FLOP-expensive or
bandwidth-cheap". They are expensive.

**`LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_WAVE_CAP=200`.** Default is `(n_slots - n_expert_used)/2` = 139 of 289 slots,
4 waves. Every wave re-runs the expert GEMM over the whole token set and masks the rest away.
44.8k context, two passes each:

| cap | target waves | prefill | decode |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 139 (default) | 4 | 268.30 | 22.43 |
| **200** | **3** | **278.39 (+3.8%)** | **23.51 (+4.8%)** |
| 279 (ceiling) | 2 | 271.78 (+1.3%) | 23.48 (+4.7%) |

**200 is an interior optimum** - past it the lost preload overlap costs more than the saved masked
passes, exactly the trade the code comment describes. The cap arms repeated to 0.1-0.4% against the
default's 1.4-1.6%.

**`LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_PARTITION=1`.** Ships disabled. Gives each (token, expert) pair to exactly one
wave instead of masking, removing the waste rather than reducing it. At 44.8k with cap 200:

| | prefill | decode | acceptance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| masked (default) | 278.27 | 23.53 | 0.844 |
| **partition** | **297.87 (+7.0%)** | **24.06 (+2.3%)** | 0.844 |

**Paired 40-chunk perplexity: bit-identical.** All 40 chunks matched exactly, PPL 4.3387 both ways.
It changes how pairs are assigned to waves, not what is computed - so this is free speed with no
quality question to answer.

Together, roughly **+11% prefill and +7% decode** over stock, both adopted in
`~/models/bin/qwen-q40-server.sh` (`WAVE_CAP=`/`PARTITION=` back them out).


#### 4. cache 40 / ctx 81920 - lossless, small

The middle setting the cache-42 arm suggests: keeps omp compaction near 49k, above the ~38k working
range, while recovering part of the +2.2%. ~50 min.
