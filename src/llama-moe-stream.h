// LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_PARTITION: give each (token, expert) pair to exactly one wave instead of running
// every wave over every pair and masking the rest to zero. ON by default; set 0 to disable.
// It only engages for multi-wave ubatches - a single wave has nothing to mask against, so decode
// keeps the plain path. Read in both llama-moe-stream.cpp and llama-graph.cpp, which must agree:
// the graph sizes the gathered tensors that the planner fills.
bool moe_stream_partition();

// SSD streaming of MoE routed expert weights
//
// Streamed layers do not materialize their ffn_*_exps tensors; instead each weight gets a
// device-side cache tensor of n_slots expert slabs, filled on demand from the GGUF file by an
// id-remapping custom op that runs on the CPU right after the router top-k. The remap only
// changes which cache slot an expert id resolves to - it never changes which experts the router
// selected, so streaming affects latency, not outputs.
//
// Missing experts are loaded by a pool of I/O threads while the remap op waits; eviction is by
// decaying route hotness with an LRU tiebreak. Reads are buffered by default, or O_DIRECT with
// LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_DIRECT=1 (bypasses the page cache; recommended when the model far exceeds RAM).
//
// note: multiple contexts decoding the same streamed model concurrently are not supported -
// one context can evict slots referenced by the other's in-flight graph.

// Read-latency histogram for expert slab reads: upper bounds in microseconds, plus one bucket for
// everything above the last bound.
//
// The mean read time cannot separate a page-cache hit from an SSD read. A hit is a ~3 MB memcpy
// (~0.2 ms), an SSD read is 1-3 ms, so the distribution is bimodal and the mean sits between the
// modes - 3.19 ms/slab is consistent with anything from 0% to 40% hits. This histogram is what
// sizes the page cache as an L2 tier behind the slot cache, which decides whether it is worth
// protecting from prefill (prefill streams ~94 GB of experts through a page cache of a few GB).
